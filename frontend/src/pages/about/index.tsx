          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded by former athletes and business professionals, we recognized the need for a trusted,
            athlete-first agency that not only supports NIL opportunities but also educates athletes on
            financial literacy, brand-building, and career planning. Our journey began with a vision to guide
            student-athletes toward sustainable success both on and off the field.
